# [CindyXR-Interactions](https://maine-imre.github.io/CindyXR-Interactions/)
This repository has a few examples of spatial interactions with spatial diagrams developed by the IMRE Lab at the University of Maine.
This project builds on CindyJS and the CindyXR plugin.  In particular, we use [CindyJS]
(https://github.com/CindyJS/CindyJS) to render spatial diagrams and use the [CindyXR](https://github.com/chrismile/CindyJS) plugin to access *select* and *squeeze* events from controllers, along with their positions in 3-spac to made the diagrams interactable.  Thank you [@chrismile](https://github.com/chrismile) for developing the event system that makes this possible!
